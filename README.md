# Appointment Management App

A simple Calendar App with managing appointments functionality.

Technologies used:

* Rails 5
* React
* Bootstrap 4
* Haml

Regarding React gems:

App is made with [react-rails] gem at first, and then, I've made transition to [react_on_rails] gem.

1. Clone app
2. Run `bundle && yarn`
3. Start the app with: `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`
